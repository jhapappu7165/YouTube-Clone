MARGIN = Space between texts in various directions

CSS SPECIFICITY: Default properties in "p" can be replaced by specific paragraphs in their respective section of the code
SELECTOR - "p", ".video-title", ".video-stats", ".video-author", ".video-description"
CSS SPECIFICITY+SELECTOR: The Selector that is more specific has higher priority
  (In terms of priority) CLASS NAME SELECTOR (.video-title) (is greater than) Element Name Selector (p)
    NOTE: It does NOT matter if the class name selector is above or below than the element name selector

TEXT ELEMENT: Exists within a text (paragraph "p" tag) and modifies a specific part of the text only
  Examples include "strong" tag for bold, "u" for underline, "span" for no visible style - all they have CLOSING TAGS

Use "margin-left", "margin-right" to add required spaces between the text
Use "style" tag to write CSS code inside HTML file
